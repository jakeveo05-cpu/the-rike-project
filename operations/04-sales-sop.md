## 3. OUTREACH SEQUENCES

### Cold Email Sequence (4 emails over 14 days)

**Email 1 - Day 0: Quick Question**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Business Name]

Hi [Name],

Noticed your business and wanted to ask:

Are you currently using AI automation for booking, follow-up, or retention?

Most local businesses lose 30-50% leads because no system runs 24/7.

I can show you exactly what you can automate in a 10-minute call.

Open to a quick chat this week?

– [Your name]
The Rike | AI Growth Agency
```

**Email 2 - Day 3: Value Add**
```
Subject: What we automated for businesses like yours

Hi [Name],

Here's what similar [industry] businesses achieved:

• +40-70% more bookings (automated follow-up)
• Google AI Overview visibility
• Consistent content without hiring

Want a free automation map for your business?

Is [Day] good for 15 minutes?

– [Your name]
```

**Email 3 - Day 7: Soft CTA**
```
Subject: Want me to stop emailing?

Hi [Name],

Not sure if timing is right, but quick offer:

I'll build you a free AI Growth Audit:

→ Content plan

If useful: great.
If not: I'll stop bugging you.

Want the free audit?

– [Your name]
```

**Email 4 - Day 14: Breakup**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

Haven't heard back, so closing your file tomorrow.

Or should I remove you from the list?

– [Your name]
```

### LinkedIn DM Sequence

**DM 1:**
```
Hi [Name], noticed you run [Business]. Quick question—

Are you using any automation for leads and follow-up?

Most [industry] owners lose 40% of leads because no one follows up fast enough.

Happy to share what's working for others if helpful.
```

**DM 2 (if no reply after 3 days):**
```
No worries if busy—just thought you'd find this useful:

We helped a [similar business] 2x their bookings in 30 days with simple AI automation.

## 8. OBJECTION HANDLING

### Price Objections

**"It's too expensive"**
```
"I understand budget is important. Let me ask—what would [result] be worth to your business? If we could show [specific outcome], would that justify the investment?"
```

**"I can get it cheaper elsewhere"**
```
"You probably can. But here's what you get with us that others don't: [unique value]. And our guarantee removes all risk. What's that worth to you?"
```

### Timing Objections

**"Not the right time"**
```
"I hear that a lot. Can I ask—what would need to change for it to be the right time? Because often, the best time to fix this is before it becomes an emergency."
```

**"Need to think about it"**
```
"Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think through? Maybe I can help answer that right now."
```

### Trust Objections

**"How do I know this will work?"**
```
"Great question. Here's a case study from [similar business]. Plus, our guarantee means if it doesn't work in 30 days, you don't pay. Fair?"
```

**"I've been burned before"**
```
"Sorry to hear that. What went wrong? [Listen] We do things differently because [explain]. And our guarantee protects you."
```
